# Queuing-Algorithms-Simulation
This repository contains series of queuing algorithms like:
- FCFS
- FIFO
- LCFS
- LRU
- SJF
<br>
And finally a full stack program that runs in console and executes them all. It was fully developed by me and was used to solve a project for university related subject.
